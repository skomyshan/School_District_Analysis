# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
###### The purpose of this analysis was to investigate the role of budget per student as it pertains to their academic progress. It has been discovered that academic dishonesty was at play and that some reading and math grades of ninth graders at Thomas High School are missing or altered. We were tasked with replacing missing scores with NaN while keeping the other data intact followed by a repitition of the school district analysis.
